## Risks and Mitigation
|Risk Area | Mitigation |
|   :---   | :--- |
| **Monetary records** | Any monetary records or transactions should be dealt with carefully. The Monefy app only provides local storage of data via .csv files. Thorough testing of various app and device states should be done to ensure  monetary related information is never lost|
| **Localization** | The Monefy app provides various currencies, hence great care must be made by ensuring Localization tools are integrated and used to test different currencies, languages and locale settings|
| **Pop up and animations** | The Monefy app relies on alerts, animations and popups. Visual snapshot testing accross multiple operating systems and form factors must be done to ensure proper functionality|
